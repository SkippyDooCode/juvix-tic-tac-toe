# Tic Tac Toe

A simple terminal based tic tac toe, created by using Juvix. This is just a testing project.

My first time coding in functional programming.
In my coding journey in almost 10 years+ (7 years active coding), either functional programming sucks or I am just a noob.

To be completely transparent, half of the code was generated and fixed by GPT-5.

## Run Locally (Linux & Mac)

Note: for windows users, please go to [Microsoft WSL installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SkippyDooCode/juvix-tic-tac-toe.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd juvix-tic-tac-toe
```

For better organize the code. create the `build` folder. Only run once.

```bash
mkdir build
```

To deploy this project run

```bash
juvix compile native -o build/Main
```

Execute the apps

```bash
./build/Main
```
